Hi, I'm Lucas Giordani (or Mnemosynum), and I've just finished my Master's degree in cybersecurity at the University of Rennes. In the past, I obtained my bachelor's degree in computer science at the University of La Rochelle.

Professionally, I had the opportunity to work as an intern at L3I (Laboratoire Informatique, Image, Interaction) at the University of La Rochelle, alongside Damien Mondou. My primary responsibility was to port a robotics supervision application from C# to Python.

I also joined the CAPSULE team at IRISA in 2023, as an intern under the supervision of Alexandre Gonzalvez and Pierre-Alain Fouque. My research focused on the implementation of Sparkle's permutations algorithm within a page fault-based weird machine on x86 architecture (IA-32).

I completed my final-year internship at Thales, where I was part of the Thalium team. My research focused on the characterization of attack infrastructures, and I had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of topics, including IDS/IPS, machine learning, network forensics, DevOps, and the red-team Cobalt Strike framework.

I am currently open to professional proposals, do not hesitate to contact me.
